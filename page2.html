<h1>Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary:-</h1>

<div id ="p">
<p>Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary is located 10 km from the city of Jamshedpur in the state of Jharkhand. 
Inaugurated in 1975 it is a notable wildlife sanctuary and contains significant population of Indian Elephants.</p>
<p>Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary is situated around the Dalma Hills. Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary is a much larger area starting from Chandil to 40 km east. The sanctuary covers around 195 km2.
It is about 100 km from the capital city Ranchi, and 15 km from the steel city Jamshedpur. 
The wildlife sanctuary runs parallel to the NH-33 with hills as high as 915 m from sea level. Dalma Sanctuary is spread over 193 km2 of forests of East Singhbhum and Saraikela-kharsawan districts of the state of Jharkhand. 
The forests of Dalma come under the category "Dry peninsular Sal" and "Northern Dry Mixed Deciduous Forest".
 Most part of Dalma forests shed leaves in the summer and attains its full bloom at the onset of monsoon.</p>

<div id ="a">
<p>The wildlife sanctuary has elephants, barking deer, sloth bear and porcupines as the main inhabitants. Famous for holding many elephants and other animals, which come downhill during the monsoons and winter and enter nearby villages and towns of Jharkhand and West Bengal. This occasionally leads to conflicts between man and elephants.</p>
</div>
<div id="b">
<p>The forest cover is denuded up to 90% because of selective pilferage by timber mafia over many years thereby creating harsh conditions for animal inhabitants here.</p>
<p>Dalma is known as paradise for elephant. The flagship species elephant count goes to 100 in number in the peak of summer where the waterholes deep inside the sanctuary quench their thirst. Recently brought four elephants are also one of the attraction points for the tourists. In past there used to be good number of deers in the sanctuary.
 With the decline in number of deers an enclosure was established with an object to breed in captivity and then release the excess deers into wild to regain the past glory. The deer enclosures at Makulakocha have spotted deers and sambhars. The enclosure is located in such a site that the spotted deers and sambars sustain with the feelingof natural habitat.</p>
